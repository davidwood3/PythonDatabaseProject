I did a EuroPython talk about my amateur attempts to drive OpenGL from Python:

The latest version of the code I'm talking about is here: https://github.com/tartley/gloopy

When people think of an "OpenGL tutorial", many will immediately think of the NeHe tutorials
by Jeff Molofee, available at http://nehe.gamedev.net/ these tutorials range from the very
simple (create an OpenGL window) through the advanced (particle systems, loading scenes
from various formats, displaying video textures, text, morphing, multi-texturing).
The older tutorials tend to be legacy-mode operations, so you should keep in mind that they
are describing old ways of working as you learn with them.
